description- 
For this task, we will develop a basic calculator using Java. The program will prompt the user to enter two numbers and select an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). After receiving the user's input, the program will perform the selected operation and display the result.

The program will begin by welcoming the user and providing clear instructions on entering the numbers and selecting an operation. The user will input the two numbers sequentially, followed by choosing an operation through a simple menu or prompt. The program will then execute the operation using conditional statements (such as if-else or switch-case) to determine which arithmetic function to apply.

The calculated result will be displayed to the user in a clear and concise format. Additionally, the program should handle potential errors, such as division by zero, by providing appropriate messages and preventing the program from crashing.

By the end of this task, we will have a fully functional Java application capable of performing basic arithmetic operations. This exercise will enhance our understanding of user input handling, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic operations in Java. It serves as a foundational exercise for more complex programming challenges.
conclusion-
This task will provide us with practical experience in creating a simple yet functional Java application. By implementing a basic calculator, we will solidify our grasp of fundamental programming concepts, including user input handling, conditional logic, and error management. Successfully completing this project will prepare us for more advanced programming tasks and boost our confidence in using Java for real-world applications.
